	Information about your data 
a.	Why did you choose the data set you working with? 
-	There’s a lot of accident happened to NYC. Create databases where you can access information is really important. 

b.	What was your dataset about? What were some of the important columns in your data and why are they important? 
-	 My dataset is about accident in NYC. The important columns are numbers of injure person because it shows that the accident have cause casualty. 

c.	What kind of things did you want to explore about your data?
-	 I wish to explore total accident that happened each year and latest accident. 


a.	 Why did you ask this question? Was there any information you wanted to learn?
-	 I asked this question because in the future I wish to predict the number of accident using this information or use this information to prevent future accident. 

b.	 Did you succeed in answering the question? If you did succeed, what did you learn? If you weren’t successful, can you propose a method which might help solve the question (i.e. different data, or using a different tool than SQL etc.)?  
-	 My attempt is unsuccessful since there are no current data that show 2022 accident. I think using python to analyze the data will be helpful or R. Using a different type of data will also be more helpful and organize. 
	
c.	Which SQL tool(s) did you use to solve the question (i.e. aggregates, joins, cases etc.)? 
	- order desc, table, 


a.	What if anything, did the project teach you? Do you have any suggestions to improve this project? What issues did you face when trying to answer your questions/copying the data (or any other issues)? 
-	This project teaches me the important of how to find a good dataset. I face the issue of understanding the dataset. 

b.	If you had unlimited time and resources (i.e. you can collect your own dataset and use tools other than SQL) what project would you pursue? 
-	If I have more time and resources, I wish to develop my code. Using a different dataset and use python to analyze the dataset. 


c.	Did you enjoy this class? What did you like? What did you dislike? Do you have any advice for improvements or other suggestions? If you have multiple authors, please separate by author 
-	I personally enjoy the class. I think this class is super helpful for my career in tech.
